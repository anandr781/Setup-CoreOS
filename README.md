# Setup-CoreOS
The objective of this project is the automate the setup of a CoreOS cluster using either :
  
  ** a minimally setup cloud config which is ready for setup and has a supporting bootstrap script file that sets up the override for ETCD3 . 
  
  **  a setup without etcd/flannel , with docker storage on NFS . This assumes Consul replacing etcd.
  
 The k8setup repo contains the next steps of setting up K8s . Please refer that repo if K8s is intended.
